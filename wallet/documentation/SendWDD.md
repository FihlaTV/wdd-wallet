Paste their address into __Send to__:   This is like their account number.  If you have their QR code, and your computer has a camera, then hit [Scan QR Code] to allow the camera to see the QR code image.  If it is a valid address, it will be recognized automatically and entered for you.

Enter the amount you wish to send, and hit [Send].

If you are connected to the internet, the WDD will be sent.  It will usually show up very quickly, but may take several minutes before it can be spent by the recipient.
